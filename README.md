# Clash_VPN_For_Ubuntu_in_China[Educational Purpose]
While staying in China, I encountered a problem downloading packages/libraries from GitHub to my Ubuntu. It's essential to download a lot of packages/libraries from GitHub.Sometimes it will not work from without vpn.
Go to this website: https://archive.org/download/clash_for_windows_pkg
Download this file : Clash.for.Windows-0.20.39-arm64-linux.tar.gz	02-Nov-2023 08:07	105.8M
Also, you can download it from here: https://share.weiyun.com/VVnBepmF

# Or follow this step-by-step
Download the file 
Unzip it.
Open that folder in the terminal where you downloaded it.
# Type  these commands in the terminal 
  tar zxfv Clash.for.Windows-0.20.39-arm64-linux.tar.gz
  cd Clash\for\Windows-0.20.39-arm64-linux
  ls
  ./cfw
It will start the vpn. If it doesn't, open the unzipped folder. You will find a cfw file, try to open it. Add your subscriptions. Now you will be successfully able to use clash vpn on Ubuntu. I tried with Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 versions, and it was working.
